# # Building a co-author graph
#
# In this notebook we're going to build an inferred graph of co-authors based on people collaborating on the same papers. We're also going to store a property on the relationship indicating the year of their first collaboration.

from neo4j import GraphDatabase
# end::imports[]

# tag::driver[]

driver = GraphDatabase.driver(bolt_uri, auth=("neo4j", "admin"))
# end::driver[]

print(driver.address)

# We can create the co-author graph by running the query below to do this:

# tag::data-import[]

CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (a1)<-[:AUTHOR]-(paper)-[:AUTHOR]->(a2:Author)
   WITH a1, a2, paper
   ORDER BY a1, paper.year
   RETURN a1, a2, collect(paper)[0].year AS year, count(*) AS collaborations",
  "MERGE (a1)-[coauthor:CO_AUTHOR {year: year}]-(a2)
   SET coauthor.collaborations = collaborations",

with driver.session(database="neo4j") as session:

# Now that we've created our co-author graph, we want to come up with an approach that will allow us to predict future links (relationships) that will be created between people.
